# Basic-algorithms
A project for basic algorithms and their variants 
This is a project containing of 5 modules 

module1:Insertion sort and its variants
This module delas with Insertion sort iterative,insertion sort recursive,Binary search based insertion sort.

Module2:Quick sort and its variants
Quick sort(), Quick_sort_pivot_middle, Quick_sort_pivot_first, quick_sort_pivot_random

Module3:Hybrid sorting and searching
Quick_insertion_sort, Merge_insertion_sort. Take a large input size and the qppropriate sort and when the partition size reaches 20 do insertion sort

Module 4, Applications:
Towers_of_Hanoi, Ladder_climbing:In how many ways one can climb the ladder, L-Shaped_triomino:Placing L shaped triomino on a chess board with one box removed

Module 5:
This module compares the performance of classical algorithms and the variants proposed in the above modules.
